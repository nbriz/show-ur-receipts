# show ur receipts!


the Internet democratized publishing, u no longer need to work w/traditional publishers (movie studios, record labels, news && academic publications) to broadcast ur message to nearly half the planet. the Internet has also drastically changed how we look for + acquire information (as well as how information looks for + finds us). this is a blessing + a curse. to the latter point, the onus is now on us to verify that what we learn online is in fact true... especially before we share that info w/others, or risk spreading misinformation. && so, on the Internet it has now become customary to ask those spilling tea to show their receipts. this website is meant to encourage digital/information literacy by generating shareable receipts.

so no excuses now, if u're gonna be posting some wild stuff online, i wanna see some receipts!
